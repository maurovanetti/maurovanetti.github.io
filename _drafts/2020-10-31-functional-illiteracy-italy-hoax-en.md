Short answer: yes, in fact 95% of the population is not functionally illiterate.

Now let's give the long answer. To begin with, when we talk about functional illiteracy we are referring to the rather vague concept that UNESCO formalized in 1975 as follows:

*"A functionally literate person is one who can engage in all those activities in which literacy is required for effective functioning of their group and community and also to enable them to continue to use reading, writing and calculation for their own and their community's development."*

It seems to me that this definition defines very little but we understand each other: a functional illiterate is either illiterate in the strict sense or someone who cannot live in society due to serious deficiencies in reading, writing and calculation. I don't even know one person I would define this way except people with serious mental problems and actual illiterates, of whom I have moreover encountered a very small number (99% of the Italian population can read and write); but I'm told that in my country they are the majority or almost. Could it be true? I'm doubtful.

In the nineties some measurements were made of functional literacy levels in various countries, using a rudimentary methodology called IALS (International Adult Literacy Survey). The quality of the results is so poor that several doubts immediately arise. For example, France, which had an extraordinarily low score in the first round, contests the methodology and thus manages to be removed from the official results. This is how an OECD paper summarizes the grotesque affair:

To respect the cliché of the Frenchman not inclined to accept second place (let alone one of the last!), this "humiliation" generates a series of statistical studies, some funded by the European Commission, aimed at understanding why France had done so badly. There's one, for example, that already from the title attacks the comparative illusion, that is, that one can really translate from one language to another a test of this kind without introducing a *bias*, a handicap. In the paper the questions where French performance is particularly poor are analyzed and four types of translation defects emerge: omissions, greater precision of the English version (English is a particularly rich language in certain areas), actual errors and other cases.

Think about it, the Swiss who speak French are similar to the French, while those who speak German are similar to the Germans. Dutch and Flemish resemble each other, as do all English speakers. There are also correlations related to geographical distance as seen in the sequence Great Britain - Northern Ireland - Republic of Ireland. In practice, this test is not well translatable and therefore international comparisons are not worth a damn.
