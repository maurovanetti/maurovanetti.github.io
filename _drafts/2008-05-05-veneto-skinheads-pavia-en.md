title: When Veneto Fronte Skinheads also troubled Pavia

Anger, sadness, disgust: for a few months I've been in London for work (another European capital fallen like Rome into the hands of the most shameless right) and today, reading the news from Verona on the subway, these are the first sensations I feel.

Once again, a menacing acronym appears in the newspapers, which I've learned to detest: **Veneto Fronte Skinheads**. This stupid and ungrammatical name, despite the geographical incongruity (for those who don't know, Pavia is in Lombardy), was also used in Pavia by the group of arrogant neo-Nazis who for years filled the pages of the local press with their exploits.

Unfortunately, my name was often on those pages too, along with that of many other comrades and friends who suffered the harassment of these provincial squadrists. One event above all: on March 28, 2003, a gang of thugs, led precisely by the Veneto Fronte Skinheads bullies, assaulted the "Barattolo" Social Center, causing injuries and damage worth thousands of euros.

For that assault there was a trial, actually two, where so far the VFS violent ones have received conviction after conviction, but never sufficient to actually make them pay with prison. Defending the most unruly was a lawyer from Verona, **Roberto Bussinello**, at the time a leader of another group, **Forza Nuova**, of which several skinheads were part. I remember him well, that lawyer, when without the slightest sense of shame he tried to reverse the role of victims and attacked, calmly asking that I be condemned for... attempted massacre! Obviously, the absurd request was rejected by the judge amid the jeers and contempt of those present.

Who defends **Raffele Delle Donne** today, confessed perpetrator for the Verona facts? La Repubblica writes today: *"lawyer Tremeloni, from Roberto Bussinello's office, a criminal lawyer who defends almost all far-right defendants in the city and ran in the last elections on Storace's list, after having long served in Forza Nuova"*.

Yes, because it must be said that Veneto Fronte Skinheads has at this moment become a kind of offshoot of **La Destra - Fiamma Tricolore**, after its historical leader, a certain **Puschiavo**, joined that party. Note that, being Fiamma Tricolore part of the majority supporting Verona's League mayor, **Flavio Tosi**, one could well say that Veneto Fronte Skinheads is today... in government of the city!

La Destra and Fiamma Tricolore naturally also exist in Pavia. Fiamma even has a local website, registered to one of the defendants in the trial for the assault on Barattolo, where we find invocations to "futurist violence" and fascist quotes like this one (taken from the Constitution of the RSI established by Hitler in Northern Italy): *"Those belonging to the Jewish race are foreigners [...] belong to enemy nationality"*.

The **Northern League**, which in Verona governs the city together with Fiamma-VFS, has had relations with these skinheads also in Pavia. Those who read the local press will remember that there was a big scandal in 2001 when the neo-Nazi chiefs of Veneto Fronte Skinheads were accused of meeting at the League headquarters, a circumstance admitted by the League's city leaders themselves. I remember it very well because I saw with my own eyes the shaved heads entering the League headquarters on Lungoticino.

Reading these lines, one will understand well why I consider these groups dangerous and why the thousand threads that bind them to larger organizations of the official right scandalize me. Banning these organizations that promote racial hatred and the arrogance of the strong over the weak, preventing them from continuing their work of propaganda and recruitment of ignorant young people who want to throw punches, closing their headquarters (the controversy against the Forza Nuova headquarters in Pavia is well known, provocatively opened a stone's throw from the "Barattolo") is dutiful, even if certainly not enough when similar ideas are advocated at all levels by unscrupulous politicians at the highest levels of the State.

It's heartbreaking to read the courageous words of Delle Donne's parents: *"We would prefer to be parents of the massacred boy rather than of our son"*. Let's prevent other boys from being massacred, other boys from being dragged into the infamous circuit of far-right violence, other parents from having to repudiate their children for the horrors that stupidity and racism make them commit. Let's prevent it starting right now.

The letter (published by Provincia Pavese on May 9, 2008) refers to the killing of **Nicola Tommasoli**. For that murder, besides the mentioned Raffaele Delle Donne, four other fascists were convicted: Federico Perini, Nicol√≤ Veneri, Guglielmo Corsi and Andrea Vesentini.

The Forza Nuova headquarters in Pavia I talked about in the letter was "besieged" by us antifascists a few months later in reaction to yet another aggression, while I was still in London, and [hastily closed](https://old.marxismo.net/antifa/antifascismo/antifascismo/chiude-la-sede-di-forza-nuova-a-pavia) by the fascists themselves the next day. Today that same venue has ironically become [our headquarters](https://santacanaglia.org/), dedicated to the communist leader and antifascist martyr Ferruccio Ghinaglia.
