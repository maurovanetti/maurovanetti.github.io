Carcassonne was invented by Klaus-JÃ¼rgen Wrede, a music and theology teacher living near Cologne. The game was published in 2000, achieving enormous success since then, leading to the publication of a large number of expansions.

This review with a scientific-analytical approach following the R-P-C schema refers to the base version of this game. It's a fast construction and placement game for 2-4 people, a typical representative of "German-style" games. A notable characteristic is the absence of a board: the playing field is built with square tiles during the course of the game.

**RULES**

In this game you do two things during your turn: you must place a square tile adjacent to tiles already laid on the table and you may optionally place one of your 7 followers on the tile just placed.

Roads and cities are drawn on the tiles that limit the legal positions where they can be placed. Although there are many different types of possible tiles, on each side of the tile there can only be one of these three things: road, city or field; adjacent sides must be of the same type.

Followers can be placed:

1.  on a road (thieves),
2.  in a city (knights),
3.  on a field, which in this case is called a farm (farmers), or
4.  on a special building that appears in the center of some tiles, the monastery (monk).

In each of these cases points are scored that depend on how "large" the element on which the follower was placed is at the end of the game.

The definition of size of an element changes according to the type of element:

1.  the length of a road,
2.  the area of a city,
3.  the number of completed cities bordering a farm or
4.  the number of tiles around the monastery tile.

The game therefore develops as a bet on which elements are susceptible to greater development, based on the remaining tiles, the topology of the tiles already placed and the interests of the other players themselves (for example, it's convenient to have a farm or monastery near cities that other players are trying to complete). To "bet" you have a limited number of pieces so there's also an incentive to be frugal, not to bet immediately, preventing yourself from being able to "appropriate" interesting elements in the future.

An important complication is that, with the exception of the farm, elements can be "completed" thus allowing players to get back the followers they had "invested" there. In this case points are scored immediately, but this makes no substantial difference (having more points doesn't trigger any negative feedback mechanism except encouraging other players to form coalitions). However, the amount of these points changes in the case of cities: tiles of a completed city are worth double those of an incomplete city. There are therefore various asymmetries that make the expected value and variance of investment in the various elements very different:

1.  a road has no maximum value and in many cases allows the return of the initial follower;
2.  a city is a doubly risky investment because if it's not completed it gives halved profit and doesn't free the meeple;
3.  a farm, being a two-dimensional area delimited by roads and cities, can become gigantic or tiny according to the behavior of all players, acquires value only upon completion of cities and in no case allows the return of the piece; in short, it's in many ways a long-term derivative investment;
4.  a monastery is similar to a road but has a maximum value (9 points, i.e., the eight tiles around and the central tile); moreover, given how the follower placement rules are defined, only whoever draws a card with the monastery has an opportunity - and only one - to appropriate that element, if they renounce it the monastery cannot be conquered later.

An aspect that introduces important tactical considerations is that an element can be co-occupied or even stolen from whoever was occupying it. The rule in fact says that an element occupied by a follower cannot be occupied by another follower (not even by the same player); however distinct elements can merge during the game into a single element, for example various road segments can connect: in this case, points go to whoever is "in the majority" as number of followers occupying that element and if there's a tie the points are given to both (not divided). Especially with cities, opportunistic moves aimed at preparing the merger between someone else's large incomplete city and your own small incomplete city are not infrequent; you can respond to this move defensively, trying to prevent the merger or prepare a further merger that gives an advantage of 2 followers against 1, or you can also decide to accept a collaboration that makes completion of the element more likely and faster.

The only randomness present, besides the tactical one due to the unpredictability of opponents' moves, is in the order of tile drawing, which however are finite in number and known. Essentially the problem is that, given a particular tile that you want to place in an advantageous way, taking the example of a 4-player game there are 3 out of 4 chances that that tile will end up in opponents' hands; if the game is with 3 players the chances drop to 2 out of 3, so playing with fewer people more audacious moves are rewarded more often. Naturally if you're not aiming for a single specific tile, but there are a certain number still in play that suit our case, the possibility that a suitable one comes to hand increases; at the beginning of the game, with many tiles still to be drawn, many ambitious plans are quite realistic, from about half of the game on gambles become treacherous.
