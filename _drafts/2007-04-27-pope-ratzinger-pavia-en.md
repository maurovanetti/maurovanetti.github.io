Even from an atheist and materialist point of view, one cannot help but draw some considerations regarding a "cultural" event relevant to the capital of our province such as Joseph Ratzinger's visit that took place on April 21 and 22. I would especially like to tell from a particular point of view that weekend as we Young Communists experienced it; I won't talk about Vigevano because we didn't follow the matter closely, but I believe that many general observations could also be applied to the Vigevano part of the papal visit.

Few but good?
=============

The first significant question for us is to understand **how many people** the Catholic Church managed to get with an extreme effort of publicizing and spectacularizing the visit of its leader. We haven't read comprehensive figures in the press, but they say 10 thousand people overall in Vigevano and 20 thousand attendees at the mass at the Borromaic Gardens in Pavia. This latter figure is nothing other than the number of seats set up by the organizers of the mass-show, but we don't know if it's the actual number.

Three evaluations seem more important to us than the absolute figure, which is difficult both to obtain and to judge: that of the bishop, that of the Vaticanists who followed the event, and that of downtown merchants.

**Bishop Poma** is the most explicit: his official statement opens by saying that *"The presence of people seemed good to me. More qualitatively than quantitatively. [...] there could have been more people"*. If we understand correctly, he's saying that Catholics in Pavia were "few but good"... meager consolation, I'd say, for an organization like the Catholic Church in Italy that isn't very used to considering itself a "well-organized minority."

Also **the Vaticanists interviewed by ***the Provincia Pavese*** noted that security measures reduced attendance; we wonder though what type of faithful is one who doesn't go to welcome the pope in his city to avoid the inconvenience of barriers: probably the deciphering of these observations is that the curious avoided downtown on "hot" days (and indeed the Vernavola park or the Vul area were packed on Sunday).

**The merchants**, finally, seem to be furious with the Municipality that led them to expect oceanic crowds that never materialized, with the aftermath of quintals of food and drinks left unsold and bars and venues left open empty until 2 AM at the mayor's request.

It seems evident, in short, that only a minority of the city considered it important to "be there," a point that calls into question the appropriateness of the **pharaonic expenses** sustained and the representation of the city as a community compactly in **enthusiastic anticipation** of the pontiff (it's on this falsehood that the entire propaganda construction was based, reinforced by welcome posters and pro-papal "regime banners," as well as the formal prohibition of any manifestation of dissent in the areas of passage of the popemobile).

Coldness
========

The snobbery of those who, like writer Mino Milani, accuse Pavia's citizenry of insensitivity because in the face of this "historic event" many raised prosaic complaints about the considerable annoyance caused by the **exaggerated security measures** is not acceptable.

The fact is that during the weekend the existence of a part of the city to which Ratzinger's visit didn't give particular mystical thrills was manifested, but rather induced a reaction that ranged from the active opposition of a minority (which we obviously tried to support and feed) to the annoyance and indifference of a very large part of the population.

This "gray area," to which a "militant" papacy like that of Benedict XVI struggles to address (privileging organized and fanatical Catholicism), found the measures adopted for the reception unjustified, and not wrongly: **the barriers and police controls** paralyzed the city for two days without the influx of pilgrims justifying it, nor does what actually happened (a mass, hypocritical official meetings and the usual speeches we hear every Sunday on TG1) seem to have ultimately confirmed the "memorability" of the event. The large screens set up for the city thus remained almost unused (completely the one in front of the Polyclinic) making the crazy expense made by the organizers even more shameful.

The only ones to be truly hyperactive and radiant were the various **organized ecclesiastical groups** like Communion and Liberation, who had their little moments of glory like the greeting of the **fake "student representative,"** the Communion and Liberation member Stefano Pellegrino (*nomen omen*), scandalously appointed from above to speak on behalf of Pavia university students, who however had not at all rewarded CL in the last university elections (and on this the UdU raised a very justified [inquiry in the Academic Senate](https://web.archive.org/web/20110323104254/http://www.coordinamento.org/2007/04/26/comunicato-stampa/ "Read the UdU Pavia press release on the Pellegrino case")).

Great works and small inconveniences
===================================

Even numerous details highlight the **"great works" logic** underlying the entire operation.

They had promised to **"renovate the city"** for the occasion and this was well seen even by the less pious; in practice, they limited themselves to repainting very few walls in the center and little else. Degraded areas of the city, construction sites open for a long time, even in the city center, received no benefit from the special interventions that should have been triggered by the papal visit.

At the Borromaic Gardens, where the most relevant works were concentrated, these focused on the useless pomp of the enormous (and hideous) altar that cost something like 50 thousand euros. In compensation, the area where many faithful were crammed was well described by a newscast as ***"a sand ditch from which nothing could be seen"***; fortunately the "authorities" who rushed to show Christian virtues had a reserved and more comfortable space.

Even **the old folks at the Pertusati hospice** seem to have had to learn a bitter lesson (which I would have gladly spared them) about the arrogance of religious hierarchies, given that the pope they had been waiting to see for days passed in front of their shelter at full speed without even greeting them. It was heartbreaking to read their desolate reactions in the local press. On the other hand, it's all too clear that even from a symbolic point of view we're faced with a papacy that wants to maintain a certain distance from the "common people," promoting a detached attitude from the masses and a privileged relationship with the conservative or reactionary *intelligentsia*. The subjects' idolatry toward the Vatican monarch, who looks at his own base from above with an arrogant schoolmaster attitude, is functional to this approach, which if we want is the same one behind the partial rehabilitation of the Latin mass.

Theology of submission
======================

Joseph Ratzinger in Pavia, besides touring the city boxed in the popemobile and giving everyone an occasion for a display of *kitsch* objects, actually also dealt with **religion**, even though that was by far the least important aspect. A few words must therefore be spent on this secondary face of the papal journey.

Ratzinger held three rallies (at the S. Matteo polyclinic, at the university and during the homily at the Borromaic Gardens) in which however similar and interconnected concepts returned. The level was always very "high," in some ways even excluding toward the bulk of the faithful: the **pope-theologian** spoke to activists of confessional movements, Catholic professionals and the intellectual or political class; for the church ladies, those who were there somewhat by chance and the people from the oratories, it was considered that the physical presence of the VIP could suffice.

References to **St. Augustine** were lavished, whose remains are preserved in Pavia at the church of St. Peter in Ciel d'Oro and who is a very important theorist for Ratzinger's thought. There were no direct references to current events, the concept that Benedict XVI was interested in developing was that of the relationship between faith and culture (understood both in general and more specifically as scientific and particularly medical culture): the vision advocated by the pontiff is that entirely medieval and anti-progressive one of Christianity (and therefore essentially of ecclesiastical power) as a unifying doctrine of human knowledge, capable of completing and synthesizing the "specialism" of different disciplines and in fact also destined (by God himself) to set limits on the practical application of these disciplines.

Secular knowledge, therefore, **handmaiden of faith**. Concretely, this means nothing other than claiming an ideological leading role for the Vatican and continuing the centuries-old battle against freedom of research (philosophical, artistic and scientific).

It's rather disturbing that the (public) university lent itself to being a sounding board for such a message, in fact denying the very sense of the existence of a place like the University. Even worse: a good chunk of **university barons** (for example rector Angiolino Stella or former rector Roberto Schmid) had no qualms about applauding from the front row and then going orderly to kneel to kiss the ring of the one who had pronounced it.

Politicians
===========

Pitiful and extremely provincial was the behavior of most politicians. The presence of Umberto Bossi and Giulio Tremonti doesn't even deserve to be commented on, from whom one couldn't expect much anyway. Also squalid was the attempt by the "Dell'Utri circles" to "plant the flag" by organizing a "concert for the pope" for Saturday evening, a circumstance that put the diocese in great embarrassment as it saw itself being politically instrumentalized (they're more used to doing the reverse). On the other hand, **Abelli's style** (having "hands in the dough" and being seen as much as possible) sets a precedent: Pavia's political feudal lord, regional councilor and murkily "friend" of both the provincial center-right and the capital's center-left, attendee of all public works inaugurations, couldn't help but also be a member, together with barons, mayors, bankers and industrialists, of the honorary committee that organized the reception for the pontiff.

Pavia mayor **Piera Capitelli** certainly deserves a prominent place in this gallery of papal boot-lickers. If already in the election campaign the DS parliamentarian (today a PD enthusiast) had produced a flyer showing her during Confirmation and then in a wedding dress on her religious marriage day, if the first official meeting she had as mayor was with the bishop, on this occasion she managed to reach new peaks in her work of humiliating state secularism. We're not only referring to the two press releases in local newspapers, where Benedict XVI was welcomed in the name of St. Augustine and then the citizenry was thanked for contributing to this "historic event," but also and especially to the declaration of wanting to promote Pavia as the "moral capital of Catholicism" due to the presence of St. Augustine's remains; the proposal, besides being ridiculous and provincial (even though it's true that an "Augustinian Center" has just been founded which we hope won't manage to develop), doesn't seem to precisely fall within the institutional duties of a municipal administration.

I finally note that the "challenge" I had launched on the pages of *la Provincia Pavese*, inviting politicians who consider themselves "secular" to **make a move**, obtained very meager results. No figure with any institutional position (think of SDI councilor Roberto Portolan, who in theory is part of a party that has made secularism its almost exclusive raison d'être and who didn't even participate in the secular initiatives organized by his own party comrades!), with the exception of left-wing municipal councilors Di Tomaso and Campari, distinguished themselves in any way on this matter. On the other hand, in Italy attacking the Church can be very risky for one's political career.

Critical voices
===============

Fortunately, secular Pavia, the **"Pavia that is not Papia,"** also made itself heard. It wasn't easy to do so, because as mentioned we suffered a restriction of spaces and in fact of the very freedom to express a contrary opinion. Posting posters against the papal visit was almost impossible, only with great effort could one "break through" the mass media and moreover almost all organized political structures were in great embarrassment every time they were invited to do something to affirm their secularism.

Saturday we Young Communists remembered as every year the killing of **Ferruccio Ghinaglia**, founder of Pavia communism assassinated by fascists on April 21, 1921. It was curious to see comrades laying a bouquet of red flowers on his monument and singing with raised fist *Red Flag* and *The Internationale* at a time when every gathering with flags and songs was suspected of papism...

Right after we went to the **unitary secular assembly**, basically organized by the radicals, at the Sala dell'Annunciata. All left-wing parties had formally given their adherence (strangely including the DS who in those days were in the front row in genuflecting to the pope!), but very few political leaders showed up at the assembly.

The first touching speech was by [Adele Parrillo](https://web.archive.org/web/20110323104254/http://adeleparrillo.splinder.com/), the partner of director and producer Stefano Rolla who died in Nassiriya in the 2003 attack (he was in Iraq to shoot a documentary film about what Parrillo defined as *"a fake peace mission"*). Partner and not wife: precisely for this reason (and probably also for her positions on the war, we add) excluded from official celebrations and become "invisible" and since then engaged in a battle so that her love story interrupted so tragically stops being hidden under the carpet by the hypocritical power of the State.

Then professors **Valerio Pocar** (who spoke with great competence and sagacity about the problems of end of life and euthanasia, faced with cynicism and insensitivity by the dogmatic Vatican hierarchies) and [Luigi Garlaschelli](https://web.archive.org/web/20110323104254/http://www.luigigarlaschelli.it/) (who in a brilliant speech accompanied by tables and slides revealed some secrets of the trafficking in miracles and saints carried out by the Catholic Church) spoke.

Finally, **Mina Welby** spoke with great humanity about the famous case that saw her husband opposed to the arrogance of the State and the Vatican to obtain at least the right to decide in freedom a dignified death.

Sunday instead the **anticlerical concert at Vul** was held, on the banks of the Ticino, which was extensively covered by the local press (in [an article](https://web.archive.org/web/20110726102716/http://www.giovanicomunistipavia.org/gli-antipapi-allarea-vul) we've already reported on this site) and which was given some space also on television with interviews of two GC comrades. Attendance was higher than expected, a few hundred young people came to listen to the improvised concert and visit the political material stands that we and the other event organizers had set up. We took the opportunity to meet some new very young and enthusiastic comrades and to produce our new official banner that we then displayed on April 25, with the beautiful red inscription *Young Communists Pavia - F. Ghinaglia Federation*.

Monday, finally, the Young Left and UdU brought dozens of people (including numerous boys from the city's homosexual community) to a successful assembly with parliamentarian **Franco Grillini** (honorary president of Arcigay, from DS, but apparently won't join the Democratic Party - and moreover we wonder with what face the Democrats of the Left can claim to defend civil rights even arriving at an organizational merger with the former Christian Democrats of the Margherita, among whom we find the Catholic fundamentalist Binetti). The young people of Forza Italia, to whom perhaps the pope's presence over the weekend had gone to their heads, had announced a "mass presence" of "citizenry" to counter Grillini's presumably anti-family opinions (called *"the/the Hon. Grillini"* in a delirious homophobic flyer), but three of them showed up making the usual bad impression. Maybe they confused the journalistic legends, which want to paint ours as a generation of papa-boys, with reality.

I wrote this article in 2007 for the Young Communists of Pavia website, of which I was the provincial coordinator at the time.
I remember that time we also made a flyer with the playful title «Little God», where it was explained that there was little divinity in Ratzinger's propaganda operation. We were kids...
