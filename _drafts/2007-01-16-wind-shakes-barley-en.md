Ken Loach's latest film is truly a perfect example of the style and message of the famous English communist director, who with this work earned himself the Palme d'Or at Cannes - and, in London, another dose of well-deserved hatred from the ruling class and its lackeys.

The film follows, through the lives of two independence-supporting brothers, the events in Ireland in the years from 1920 until the outbreak of civil war following the signing of the fraudulent "peace treaty" with Great Britain.

The film is truly an anti-Michael Collins: if in that film about the leader of the "possibilist" wing of Irish nationalism the virtues of this leader who compromised with British imperialism are magnified, while deprecating the alleged extremism of the treaty's opponents, personified by the ambitious Eamon De Valera (future first president of the Irish republic), The Wind That Shakes the Barley completely reverses the perspective and shows the deceptions of the negotiation that transforms into betrayal, of reformism that transforms into reaction, of peace with the oppressors that becomes war against the oppressed.

The equivalent of Michael Collins (on a smaller scale) for Loach is one of the two brothers, Teddy O'Donovan. A rather ruthless IRA leader until 1923, when peace is signed between the British Empire and Sinn Féin (which immediately splits in two precisely on this), he quickly transforms into a staunch defender of the agreement with the imperialists, proudly donning the uniforms of the "Irish Free State," nothing more than a dominion within His Majesty's Empire, under the indirect control of the British Crown which essentially delegates to Collins' supporters the tasks that were previously those of its fierce colonial troops.

Loach has no psychological illusions nor gets lost in populist discourse about "human nature": the choice, fundamentally collaborationist, of Teddy, who turns his weapons against his old comrades and finally even against his brother, is a class choice. History books teach us that in the period of the "Free State" the defenders of the peace treaty even went so far as to establish a special police force with the specific task of defending Protestant landowners from the "violence" of peasants and laborers who invaded their lands, supported by the republican left. Even Teddy openly sides with the owners, as long as they're "patriots." Already in the heated period of the struggle against the English, defending an Irish loan shark he quarrels with his brother Damien and with the railway worker, trade unionist, republican and communist, who first opened Damien O'Donovan's eyes: for Teddy you can't go against the usurer, because "he's an Irishman" and finances the IRA, and it doesn't matter if the old woman strangled by debts is also Irish and if even the "people's tribunal" that wants to defend her is composed of republicans; for Damien, for his partner Sinead, for the railway worker, it makes no sense to fight for national liberation if it doesn't serve as a crowbar to dismantle class privilege: in their eyes the loan shark is "like the English," Ireland's oppression by England is a replica on an international scale of the same class contradictions. In the quarrel heavy words fly, some accuse others of only wanting to paint the old and rotten Irish class society green, the others reply that it's still better to paint it green than red... But the real clash, no longer in words but with gunshots, will emerge only later, when the Crown understands that it's precisely on these contradictions that it can leverage to dominate the colony indirectly.

Like all respectable committed films, this one too makes a discourse on consciousness-raising - or its lack. There are no "good" or "bad" characters without depth. Teddy and Damien come from a well-off country family, the left-wing brother accuses the other of not having freed himself from that social legacy, but he himself becomes conscious later than others, after having long cultivated the illusion of doing good simply through his profession (i.e., medicine: the figure of the young idealist doctor who gives himself to the Revolution and sacrifices his life to it is familiar to us, from Che Guevara to our Pavian martyr, Ferruccio Ghinaglia). After the killing of a friend who persisted in speaking Gaelic to the English colonial forces, crucial for him is witnessing the courageous resistance of railway workers to the transport of monarchist troops. The railway worker who with great dignity refuses to obey the brutal orders of the colonialists because it would mean violating his union's instructions, is fundamentally a very clear symbol of the possibility of an alternative power to that of bosses and imperialists; on the other hand, one cannot help but smile pleased in the face of the usual bourgeois obtuseness when the soldiery to make the train leave... beats up the railway worker with punches and kicks: it's the usual problem of the bourgeoisie, it would like to do without rebellious workers but it still needs someone to "pull the cart"! the stupid soldiers thus remain on foot anyway.

Damien thus enters the IRA, in which his brother was already a recognized figure at the local level; but the railway worker will be his true political reference point: while for Teddy the struggle is a national war disguised as civil war, for Damien it's a civil war disguised as national war and he's enthused by the railway worker's quote from James Connolly, the revolutionary leader, close to the Russian Bolsheviks, killed by the English after the Easter Rising of 1916: "You may indeed plant the green flag on the highest flagpole in Dublin, but if you do not establish a socialist republic, the English will continue to dominate you through the capitalists, through the commercial banks and through the latifundia." Shiver down the spine: those among the film's spectators who understand what the phrase means seem to easily share this rigorously Marxist reasoning (but which is fundamentally pure common sense), but it's not an everyday thing to hear talk of "socialist republic" at the cinema!

There has naturally been much talk about violence in this film. The subject seems to greatly fascinate the various moralists who find it curious and fundamentally also a bit scandalous that a film that isn't by Governor Schwarzenegger dwells with benevolent eye on copious transfers of blood from someone's circulatory system to the floor. We know that there is no reasoning about liberation that is not also reasoning about violence. For Loach, violence against the English doesn't deserve particular justification; the exercise of showing the brutality of colonial occupation is naturally carried out, to trigger an inevitable mechanism of identification with the oppressed, but you can see that the director doesn't pay much attention to it, those who doubt the opportunity for a people to free themselves by all necessary means won't find arguments in this film to convince themselves. Tullio Kezich in an obtuse review laments precisely this about the film, that it was too "partial" in favor of the Irish! There would be reason to laugh if there weren't reason to cry, but on the other hand finding the review hosted by the weekly magazine of the "third way" Corriere della Sera, we're not surprised that Kezich expected (but has he ever heard of Ken Loach?) a fence-sitting film, maybe even a bit "revisionist" à la Pansa, that would also show the advantages of colonialism and the flaws of the republican front. The same disoriented reviewer, in fact, rejoices in the fact that at least in the second half ample relief is given to the germ of human wickedness that has penetrated even the nationalist camp; it seems evident to me that we're faced with a case of failed communicative intent due to target mismatch, this is not a film for Tullio Keziches and their exposure to the film can lead to unforeseen results. For Loach naturally the second half is not about the human misery of the oppressed who "quarrel among themselves," on the contrary his sympathy (and ours) goes entirely to the "troublemakers" who immediately break the (interclass) unity of the republican front in the face of the betrayal of the Michael Collinses and Teddy O'Donovans.

The film therefore neither apologizes for nor finds excuses for violence against tyrants and exploiters. The king of England is attributed with naturalness more or less the same humanity as Emperor Ming from Flash Gordon. While however in Michael Collins we find a complacency (inexplicable in a film that is fundamentally moderate and respectable) in depicting the heroic but fundamentally terrorist actions of the IRA gunmen, in The Wind That Shakes the Barley we glimpse a critique (especially in the ambush scene) also of the military tactics of petty-bourgeois nationalism, which makes a caricature of a regular war triggering a whole series of mechanisms (blind patriotism, obedience to leaders, flattening of conflict on national bases) that in fact hinder the transformation of the liberation struggle into social revolution. In Michael Collins, the individual terrorism is even contrasted (for pure spirit of adulation toward Collins) with guerrilla warfare with pitched battles, making the first appear as the "wise" and "plebeian" tactic of the protagonist, while the second would be a mad indulgence (because doomed to defeat for technical reasons) of cunning and ambitious politicians, but also very lacking in practical sense, like De Valera. Well...

Moving to the opposite front, Ken Loach has no pity or empathy toward British colonialists and their collaborators. Without justifying them even a little (to the great disappointment of the various Tullio Keziches), he tries however to explain them. The soldiers first of all, who frequently appear brutal in dealing with a population they don't understand because it doesn't accept Crown dominion, to which they obviously attribute a civilizing function toward the "Fenian bumpkins," but also dismayed when the people's rebelliousness erupts in violent actions against them. One of them explains to a revolutionary under arrest that they finished fighting in trenches for the Crown just a few years ago, how can they be asked to betray their own country? Certainly, in this case these are ideological motivations (in the Marxian sense, I mean of "false consciousness"), in reality the soldiers deceive themselves believing that torturing Fenians is in their interests. Someone realizes this, and breaks the deadly mechanism of command on which the entire apparatus of exploitation rests: the prison door is opened by a courageous recruit, who sympathizes with the Irish cause. It's no longer just ideology, instead, but also lucid class consciousness that drives the landowner, Irish but Protestant, for whom a young republican militant works to denounce him and his mysterious friends who often come to visit him on the estate conspiring mysteriously in the stable. The boy is captured and out of cowardice gives the names of his comrades, who are taken and tortured. When the rebels' revenge falls on the landowner, he makes a proud declaration of adherence to his class's cause: "You will never prevail!", and he says it with prophetic certainty that suggests that he too, from his social side, had Connolly's lesson very clear. Certainly, he too yields to ideology, one would say sincerely, when he also raises a confessional motivation: "I will not let my country fall into Catholic barbarism"; if it's true, as has been said, that this film also talks about the occupation of Iraq, this is the point where the analogy becomes most stringent, with recourse to the superstitions of the oppressed (in the Iraqi case, "Islamic fundamentalist barbarism") as justification for their oppression. Even the Texas rangers (here I'm being influenced by the beautiful The Broken Collar by Valerio Evangelisti) persecuted Mexican immigrants adducing the excuse of their "papist" backwardness ("Look how they treat their women," as the male chauvinist Leaguists in Italy say today against Arab immigrants), except then they took it out mainly on leftist Mexican activists, anticlerical and priest-eaters to the bone. The problem deserves reflection: on one hand it should invite revolutionaries to a cautious and attentive attitude toward the prejudices of the oppressed (we wouldn't want to behave with them as exploiters do?), on the other hand a struggle to overcome them is crucial and I would like on this to refer to a beautiful article I read in Starry Plough, the magazine of the Irish Republican Socialist Party, in favor of abortion rights in Éire (a courageous position, because even among left republicans Catholic hostility toward abortion is very widespread): it explained that Catholic fundamentalism in Ireland was not only a crime against Irish women but was also an obstacle to the unification of the Island, as it strengthened in the Protestant community in Ulster the conviction that the liberation of Northern Ireland would mean the imposition of a theocracy subject to the Vatican.

In general however religion in Loach's film counts little, even though a certain confessional characterization of the clash is correctly (from a historical point of view) shown (evanescent, perhaps for political correctness, in the other film I've now cited too many times). The most significant moment is when, after the proclamation of the Free State, all the fellow villagers of the O'Donovan brothers, now split in two by civil war, go to mass (including Damien and Sinead and other communists clearly with strong inclinations toward atheism, but in old leftist jargon one would say these are "contradictions among the people"): the priest thinks well to read, harshly criticizing its various slogans, a leaflet from the republican left that criticizes the peace treaty and, what is more serious in the priest's eyes, incites class struggle, advocating the expropriation of factories and the division of lands. From the pews the group of intransigents (quite numerous, and this too is historically plausible) gets up to openly criticize the homily, everything ends in a brawl and indignantly half the assembly of faithful gets up and leaves the church after the proud phrase spat by Damien at the priest: "Once again, the Catholic Church sides with the bosses against the people."

Violence in the film is also "fratricidal" though. Here too, Loach doesn't give in to moralist banalization. An Irishman can shoot another Irishman for many different reasons. Shooting the collaborationist boss, however much he was born in Ireland, clearly has nothing fratricidal about it, it's an extension of the national liberation struggle and also of class struggle. But what to do with the boy, IRA militant, who betrayed his comrades not only by rattling off their names to the enemy, but also by avoiding, out of fear and shame, warning them as soon as possible of the danger they were running and "turning himself in" to the republican command? Damien and his comrades are ordered to shoot the "traitor" in one of the most "strong" and touching scenes; they don't know what to do, the merciless request seems to them a total enormity: Damien will want to obey the terrible order; the boy, who has remained despite everything a fervent republican, asks as a last wish not to be absolutely buried "near that one there," his boss who is killed without too many ceremonies right before him. It's interesting to see Damien's evolution in this regard; a moralist screenplay would want the young republican in the full of revolutionary enthusiasm willing to shoot the boy without thinking twice, friend of the family and known for a lifetime, and subsequently, with the struggle turning in on itself and the outbreak of civil war, having a thousand doubts and, finally far from the "dehumanizing" heat of revolutionary fervor, becoming wise and bitterly understanding the vanity and sinfulness of his actions; conversely, in this film we have the opposite: at the moment Damien is bewildered, decides to be the one to shoot him almost just to stay closer to him in the fatal moment and somehow carry out "gently" that task, but considers it a tremendous, crazy thing. When then, years later, he falls prisoner to his former comrades in struggle who have become, to put it hastily, sellouts, he doesn't think "Here, history repeats itself but now I'm in the victim's part," with attached historical pessimism and so on; on the contrary, he displays to his "sellout" brother who will shoot him the next day (and with this I've shed light on the last corners, remaining in shadow, of the plot) that burden he had to bear as a further mark of infamy toward those who betrayed the cause: "I for this cause had to shoot a friend, how can you ask me to betray it?". All the more so since the betrayal is so infamous as to anyway cost the price of shooting a brother. Violence doesn't ennoble the struggle, but neither does it degrade it: it makes it laden with so many additional and often superfluous sufferings as to require that at least such efforts be given adequate redemption.

One last consideration must be made on the historical level, and perhaps shows the film's greatest lack (not from an artistic point of view, but undoubtedly from a political one): what happened after? Did the Teddys or the Damiens prevail? Actually formally neither. The Irish Free State has a short life, it's officially founded after Collins' killing, in December 1922. In 1932 Cosgrave, Collins' successor (and decidedly more moderate and anticommunist than him) is defeated in elections by the new Fianna Fáil party, led by the more radical Eamon De Valera, who had led the intransigent wing during the Civil War. The Free State apparatus is gradually dismantled (with the proclamation of Éire in 1937) and in the span of a few years, also with the help of World War II and the start of a decolonization process on a world scale, an independent republic is formed with the exception of the northern part of the island which remains occupied by the British. In domestic politics, however, De Valera realizes exactly Connolly's negative prophecy: tricolor flags are hoisted on the seats of political power but Capital's invisible flag remains hoisted on all other buildings. Retrospectively, it's often stated that subsequent events demonstrated that Collins was right to say that the Peace Treaty with the British Empire didn't guarantee freedom but guaranteed "the freedom to obtain freedom"; there exists a quote from an elderly De Valera, with which the film Michael Collins closes, in which "Dev" symbolically reconciles with his opponent, saying that Collins' figure should be revalued. The truth is that bourgeois and petty-bourgeois nationalism, even when "intransigent," not linking the "social question" to the national question, always ends in one form or another of opportunism. The same Provisional Sinn Féin (those usually meant in Italy when we say "IRA"), which maintained for decades toward Éire a position similar to that of De Valera toward the Irish Free State, then ended up, with the Good Friday Agreement, following a path of compromise entirely similar.

De Valera's victory, and the current existence of a capitalist island, dominated by the Catholic clergy and split in two by the criminal "divide et impera" policy of British imperialism, is in the end an ironic revenge of Teddy O'Donovan. Damien O'Donovan is still waiting for the Socialist Republic of Ireland dreamed of by James Connolly. And we with him.
