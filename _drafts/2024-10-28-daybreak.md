Daybreak is one of my favourite boardgames 

Review based on the Rules-Play-Culture model.

**RULES**

Victory condition: Being a cooperative game, the players win together or lose together. They represent "World Powers" (more about this below!) struggling to stop climate change. In order to win, they need to reach **Drawdown**: a situation in which the amount of Carbon cubes emitted in the last turn is *less* than the amount of Carbon cubes absorbed. That's it.

The players lose if they don't manage to reach Drawdown before one of these catastrophic conditions are triggered:
1. any of the World Powers has accumulated too many "Communities in Crisis" tokens. 
1. the Thermometer has reached a certain threshold;
1. it's taking too long (6 rounds).

The threshold on Communities in Crisis is actually the true "hard" condition: most matches would get the same outcome with this condition only, because high temperature causes more crises, and cumulative effects cause a defeat if the game drags along for too long. This helps simplifying the rules as a race against the clock to keep in check the accumulation of both Carbon cubes and Communities in Crisis.

Carbon cubes are the main resource, and they are related to Communities in Crisis in many indirect ways. You could quite easily get rid of Carbon cubes if you could freely generate Communities in Crisis, but you cannot unless you want to reach an early defeat. For instance, you could cut "dirty" electricity production that causes the lion's share of Carbon emissions, but if you produce less electricity than your population's needs, you get one Community in Crisis token per missing Carbon cube. And the energy needs of your population usually grow at each turn, therefore you need to *replace* dirty electricity with green electricity if you want to do it sustainably.

Carbon cubes are generated each turn by a combination of factors, indicated as brown icons on each player's mat: dirty electricity, polluting industry, farming, extraction, housing, refuse management, transport. The game is very asymmetric, every mat setup is different, according to the real-world geographic and economic differences it models. The brown icons can be removed by player actions, and green-electricity icons can be added. There is no "green industry" and the like, these emissions are just implicitly replaced by environmentally sound alternatives. Electricity works differently because the authors wanted to model the complex strategic choices regarding green power.

Carbon cubes that are not absorbed at the end of the turn cause several harmful consequences. They directly increase world temperature on the Thermometer, which in turn increases the number of Crisis cards drawn and the number of dice cast to trigger the Planetary Effects. Crisis cards are bad and damage the players in many different ways, but in the end they amount to risking to increase your Communities in Crisis. Planetary Effects are very bad and work indirectly as multipliers on the speed of the catastrophe, by changing several parameters when a "tipping point" is reached. This is an avalanche effect similar to those found in the Pandemic series. The distribution curve of the harmful effects is complex and has [long tails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail), like its real-life inspiration.

So, in Daybreak, players have to reduce net Carbon production, aiming for Drawdown, and at the some time prevent an excess of Communities in Crisis. As already explained, Carbon production can be influenced by modifying the energy mix (more green tokens, less dark tokens) and getting rid of the other dark tokens with icons. Communities in Crisis can be prevented by collecting defensive Resilience tokens, and as a last restort by spreading the harm properly among the players -- one player with too many Community in Crisis tokens is enough to make everone lose. In order to pursue these goals, the players run Projects, both Global and Local.

Projects are cards. Beautiful cards, with a nice image, some icons on top, and a symbolic description of their effects. The icons on top are "tags"; tags are used as requirements to activate the card, and sometimes the more icons of a certain tag you have, the stronger the card effect becomes. There is also a QR code in the bottom right corner of each card, if you scan it with your phone you can reach a page like this with the full explanation of the real-life equivalent of the Project and its workings in the game. Projects, when activated, influence the other elements of the game, creating or destroying resources, applying transformations, modifying other cards, enabling the transfer of resources to other players, etc. The network of effects and connections between the cards is very complex and is the core content of the game.

Global Projects are picked by a common deliberation of all players at every turn, and activated by sacrificing some of their cards. Individual players are always in a trade-off choice between using the cards in their hand to develop their Local Projects or contributing to the activation of a Global Project.

The most peculiar mechanics of Daybreak is about the Local Projects, though. Each player can have no more than 5 Local Projects running at the same time. With each of the (usually 4, sometimes more) cards in their hand, they can interact with the cards already played. They can:
- Start a new Local Project, by placing a card in front of an existing stack of face-up cards. This disables the current Local Project represented by the front card of the stack, and enables a new one represented by the new card. This new Local Project will take advantage of all the icons of the stack.
- Support an existing Local Project, by tucking a card below an existing stack. This gives more stack tags, which can make the effect stronger, or prepare to fulfill the requirements of another alternative Project.

There are many other details, like cards being used to weaken or prevent Global Crisis, but basically this is how the whole system works.

**PLAY**

The main choices in the central game loop are like:
- Should I use this card to start a new Local Project or keep it to fuel something else?
- Which Local Projects should I activate and in which order?
- How much should I spend in Resilience, in Global Crisis prevention, in Global Project development?
- How am I going to support the increased energy demand next turn?

This kind of choices make it feel a lot picking a policy mix. Part of it is keeping a balance, mostly between rushing towards the victory condition and putting some resources aside as emergency backup (mostly through Resilience or investment in cutting down the likelihood of destructive crises). Part of it is choosing a road map to pursue, and implement it in the proper order.

Sometimes, engines are built, when an action enables another action that in turn modifies your status in a more beneficial direction, but usually this cannot be iterated more than two or three times. For instance, you might use [Universal Public Transport](https://www.daybreakgame.org/card/1076) to get rid of a dirty Transport token by increasing your Energy Demand, and use [Thermal Solar](https://www.daybreakgame.org/card/1017) to increase your green Energy production to compensate for the increase in demand; the latter would cost you discarding one card, which you can usually afford. If you happen to have managed to start the corresponding Local Projects with the right tags, you have created a combo engine that reduces your Carbon emission by 1 per card discarded. Unfortunately, you cannot overuse this because, even if you are playing the SUV-obsessed United States, you won't have more than 5 dirty Transport token; once you have removed them all, the combo turns useless and the Project slots, cards and tags have to be recycled into something else.

At every turn a new hand of cards is drawn from a very large deck. Most cards are unique. This gives a refreshing feeling of possibilities opening up, but at the same time it can be frustrating for players who are aiming at building a powerful engine that requires a specific tag; cards can be kept in hand from previous turns, which allows for this kind of long-term attempts. "Useless" cards -- useless in the current situation, not useless per se -- can always be spent to activate Projects or for their tags. It's the rare case when a card drawn has no use whatsoever.
