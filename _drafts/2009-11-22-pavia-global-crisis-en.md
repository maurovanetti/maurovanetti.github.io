The global economic crisis has its repercussions also in the province of Pavia. Last December the provincial secretariat of CGIL raised the alarm: in our province during 2009 something like 2,500 jobs could be lost. The Excelsior data series for 2009 provides some interesting information on expected employment flows that roughly confirm the concerns of the Chamber of Labor: for this year in the province 5,000 exits from the world of work are expected against 3,500 hires. Interesting to discover that even in a deindustrialized province like Pavia the bulk of hires (over 70%) will come from companies with over 50 employees: in short, the "fabric of small businesses" of which so much is said will certainly not save us (only 10% of hires will come from companies with under 10 employees). A good part of job losses affects precarious workers: the most exploited and most blackmailable are also the first to be left out as soon as there's a crisis, confirming that precariousness doesn't solve employment problems.

One can take comfort, however, by noting that Pavia data is better than that of most other Lombard provinces: the PV-branded economy was already so messed up that there wasn't even much room for worsening!

A report by the Pavia Chamber of Commerce indicates a 9% drop in industrial production in Pavia and province in the second quarter of 2009. In the same quarter orders fell by 15.8% for the domestic market and 5.5% for the foreign market. The announcements of recovery or little recovery that appeared in newspapers and television at the end of summer were not enough to avoid new industrial crises starting from September. The other article on this page tells us about the story of Eckart in Rivanazzano, a plant that announced closure a few weeks ago, causing an all-out strike by its employees. The struggle of Eckart workers however concluded with an agreement that establishes the loss of dozens of jobs.

Another case among many is that of Sigma in Vigevano, a company that produces numerical control work centers; in crisis, its sale to a new buyer is underway with the intention of "restructuring" it, that is, leaving about eighty people at home.

A document published by the Pavia Chamber of Commerce (in the presence of the omnipresent Gianfranco Abelli) says that Pavia can make it and indicates sectors like Healthcare that would have emerged unscathed from the crisis. Maybe, but even there they take advantage of the general context to hit working conditions, as the workers of cooperatives (cooperatives... sui generis, let's say) who handle cleaning at Pavia's S. Matteo Hospital have learned, where, with a questionable "contract change," they found themselves doing the same work as before under much worse conditions. On the other hand, even many of the metalworking companies (the sector most hit by recession in the province) declared "in crisis" are actually just taking advantage of the opportunity to obtain social safety nets and conduct restructuring that was already being prepared before the crisis began.

On the Repubblica website there's an interesting service mapping the economic crisis, you can get there by visiting http://vaime.org/mappacrisi. You can have fun (so to speak) looking for the files of companies in crisis in the Pavia area, at the moment there are 52 with many cases of recourse to layoff benefits, layoffs, closures or bankruptcies.

We're so used to the fact that our lives depend on global economic trends that we're not even surprised anymore to discover that hundreds of families can find themselves facing the nightmare of unemployment because of the infamous recession. The share of foreign turnover in the province is 30%, a growing figure that indicates the significant dependence of the Pavia economy on the world market. The still disastrous economy of our province is very export-oriented; if we add to this the impressive data on commuting to Milan and other places, we understand how those who live in our province either work elsewhere or produce goods that will be consumed elsewhere, a condition of economic subordination similar to that of underdeveloped countries.

Capitalism and its periodic crises are a common evil, but this shouldn't push us to think of it as half joy. Rather, let this be an opportunity for our fellow citizens to broaden their horizons beyond Siccomario or the Becca bridge: we too are part of a globalized world subject to the whims of capital. Against the horrors of the global economic system, the world is scattered with struggles and equally international resistance: let Pavia too find its place on the barricades!

This article was published in the first issue of **Bonarda**, "the red and lively Pavia aperiodic," a free local newsletter we produced for about a year. Not all articles were so serious, but the effort to investigate workers' conditions was tenacious in all issues. Unfortunately online the articles appeared only as Facebook notes, so they're not easy to find; the newsletter was distributed simply by leaving it around in hundreds of copies and organizing presentation and self-financing aperitifs.
