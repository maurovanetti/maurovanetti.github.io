During a summer holiday by the sea, many years ago, I invented **a variant of Connect 4** together with Errico De Lisi and Giuseppe Sguera. We called this game **Doh!**, after Homer Simpson, of course.

Back from vacation, I wrote the rules of this game on a [FidoNet](http://www.fidonet.org/) area that dealt with board games and played a few distance games with other users of that primitive amateur network -- at the time I didn't have access to the Internet yet, especially considering that my modem ran at 2400 baud.

Years later, searching for my full name on a search engine (and who hasn't done that?), great was my surprise to find not only that old rulebook I had sent *[the site has since disappeared, as it was hosted on Geocities]*, but also its translations [in English](http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/gv/doh.htm) and [in Czech](http://www.deskovehry.info/pravidla/doh.htm) on sites specialized in board games, and [myself listed in lists of board game inventors](http://www.abstractstrategy.com/authors-v.html)…

Here are the rules of the game:

1.  It is played by two players on a rectangular game board 7 squares wide and 6 squares high.
2.  Players take turns placing a token of their color in the lowest square of a non-full column.
3.  Whoever manages to compose the four vertices of a square with their tokens and announces it by exclaiming *"Doh!"* wins. The squares can be straight, diagonal or skewed; moreover, by convention, you also win by placing your tokens on the 4 vertices of the 7 × 6 rectangle that makes up the entire game board. The image provides examples.

If anyone starts playing Doh! please absolutely let me know!
