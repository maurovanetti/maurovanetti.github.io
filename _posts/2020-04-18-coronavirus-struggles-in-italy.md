During the 2020 Spring pandemic, I've been invited to speak at an online meeting by IMT Madison, a Wisconsin branch of the International Marxist Tendency.

The meeting's recording is available on Facebook. I spoke an embarrassing English but hey, it was 2am here.

[My PowerPoint presentation](/files/Italy%20-%20workers'%20struggles%20in%20the%20coronavirus%20crisis.pptx) can also be downloaded. That's a bit better.
